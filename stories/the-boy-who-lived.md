# The boy who lived

Early memories are buried in a Labyrinth, submerged by dozens of weary eyes.

I grew up in a Californian, suburban cul-de-sac. 
Streets were lined with dried-out palm trees. Uneventful weekends were reduced to sweat from playing outside. Afternoons were wasted reading comic books at the library and attending library-hosted music and art events, which is where we'd learn calligraphy or listen to a local musician cover the Beatles or learn classical chess. We've attended all the local magic and acrobatic shows. Some family evenings are hunched over at the local buffet, stuffing as much food as humanly possible. We'd race ribsticks and bicycles down the slow, insipid roads. An older student would always read more than me during the Fremont Main Library's summer reading challenges. Our dog days were left undisturbed to watch the night sky with our parents laughing over something that happened a few days ago while my sister and I sat on the sun-warm top of the Toyota. Baba would always come out with a bag of sunflower seeds or peanuts.

Boredom was the precursor to excitement.
My sister and I always found something to entertain ourselves.
There was a bubble casing around our street and nothing beyond that mattered much to us.

One day, my sister had taught me the rules for tag. I had barely learnt how to walk.
Obediently, I chased her. As she made a sharp turn, I ran right into the concrete wall behind.
My parents took me to the hospital and I got stitches.
That's how I got my first scar on the bottom of my widow's peak.

On Earth's day before my fifth birthday, my family had made plans to see an Earth's day event.
We were having breakfast at our glass dinner table.
We had the sweetly flavored congee my mom used to make.
Baba always added a spicy LaoGanMa sauce despite Mama's complaints.
My dad and my sister were wolfing down their breakfast, while I was throwing a tantrum.
I was furious for young reasons.
I was furious but don't remember why.
I was furious that Mama didn't notice.
I grabbed a back of rocks my sister was collecting for her class and pounded them on the glass table which cracked the surface.
Then, without receiving further attention from Mama, I threw my head on the table like a hammer in a fit of rage.

The entire table shattered into a million pieces.
Glass shards were sticking out of my head.
The skull was fractured.

I don't remember what exactly happened from this moment on.
Only that tears had blurred my vision to the point that I don't have clear visual memories.
I'm told you could see the inner flesh and the beating brain ooze.
What I do remember is seeing my father cry for the first time.
In that moment, I stopped crying in hopes that he'd stop crying.

I got stiches. Of course, everyone canceled their plans for the day.
The doctors made it clear that I'd have a scar on my forehead for my entire life.
Mama was devastated. She thought it'd affect me in my later years.
For years she'd rub retinol capsules on my scar to reduce its transparency.

These scars are forever part of me.
